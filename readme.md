Build You A Tomato Keyboard!

in which we build a ortholinear 30% keyboard with fully programmable RGB backlighting.
This keyboard is a variant of the (relatively) famous Gherkin keboard.

TL;DR solder things in the following order:
1. [Capacitors](#capacitors)
2. [Lights](#lights)
3. [Resistor](#resistor)
4. [Diodes](#diodes)
5. [Pro Micro pins](#pro-micro-pins)
6. [Switches](#switches)
7. [Pro Micro](#pro-micro)

# Capacitors
The capacitors are the hardest part of this whole build, and you get to do them first! These are the tiny little rectangles that probably come in a cardboard strip, held in with tape. They are SMD mounted, which basically means that they are little and to not bother soldering them unless you are a surgeon.

There are basically four ways to solder SMD components. If you make more money (or time) than I do, you can buy (or make) a reflow oven. A much cheaper, but non-free option is to get a hot air rework station. If you are like a surgeon, then you can do them by hand with a soldering iron. I used a cast iron griddle on my gas powered kitchen stovetop. I would probably recommend the skillet method or the hot air station.

If you want more information on the skillet option, check out the [sparkfun article called "Reflow Skillet"](https://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/59). This method is maybe faster than hot air, but less forgiving. I'll assume this method for this guid. If you want info on other methods, then I suggest google or youtube, or open a pull request ;-).

The good news is that all the capacitors wired to eachother (parallel circuit), so if you break one off or something it's no big deal, the others will pick up the slack. The bad news is that if you short one of them, then you short your entire lighting circuit.

For this step you will need tweezer, a small bowl, solder paste, and a hot flat surface.
